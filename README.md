I went with a dark mode theme for my redesign of the Prepr app. I personally prefer being able to toggle between dark and light modes and choose this as the main inspiration for the redesign.

The EXPLORE page is the ONLY page that is responsive to tablet and mobile resolutions. All other pages are designed for desktop view.

This project was created using React.</br>
To start the app run `npm start`
